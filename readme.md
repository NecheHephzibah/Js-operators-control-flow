Symbols for JavaScript operators 
1. 
1a. Arithmetic Operator
- Addition +
- Subtraction -
- Multiplication *
- Division /
- Modulus %
- Increment ++
- Decrement --

1b. Assignment Operators: =

1c. Comparison Operators:
- Equals to ==
- Strict equal to ===
- not equal to !=
- less than <
- greater than >
- less than equal to  <=
- greater than equal to  >=

1d. Logical Operators

- >>





2a. Addition 
example: 
let a = 3;
let b = 2;
let sum = a + b; // 5

Division
example: 
let price = 500;
let quantity = 7;
let total = price * quantity; // 3500

2b. Assignment Operator example:
let Barry = 9; 
const price = 50.69

2c. Comparison operators examples
let a = 5;
let b = 5;
a == b // TRUE

let cup = 4;
let spoon = 3; 
cup != spoon; // TRUE

2d. Logical Operators Example
let cup = 4;
let spoon = 3;
cup < spoon; // TRUE

let cup = 4;
let spoon = 3;
NOT cup < spoon; // TRUE

2e. Bitwise Operator example
let a = 5;

5 << 1 // 10 (which is the binary result of 101 << 1, because the bits are shifted one position to the left)

5 >> 1 // returns 2 (which is the binary result of 101 >> 1, because the bits are shifted one position to the right)


4. for (let i = 1; i < 20 i += 7) {
    console.log(i);
} // 8, 15, 22
